# DesignoDesigner
This is a basic project whose main aim was to develop a system that can design web components for web developers in easiest manner.
The developer can just select a component element from a dropdown and can directly play with its css values to create mind blowing componenets.

This project is based on MERN stack and its primary goal was to create a working system.This goal for the system has been completed.
The next target goal for this system is to develop a beautiful UI and UX.

## If you have liked the project you can directly read the code as it is self explainable and very easy
The project also includes a great care for the security of the users information.

If you do have any problems in  understanding the code you can email me directly.
